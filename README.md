# NeedHelpESP32

Hi there. If you are reading this, you might have come from my reddit post. I have followed this tutorial: https://thesolaruniverse.wordpress.com/2021/11/05/displaying-color-pictures-on-a-240x240-tft-screen-with-st7789-controller-with-an-esp32-wroom-32/ and the display does not display anything even though it powers on. In this repository is the code. If possible, can you please tell me what the issue is. Thanks.
